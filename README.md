I'd be glad to create the documentation (.md) for your Flask API and test script:

**API Documentation (rev_main.py.md)**

**Title:** Used Revenue Price Prediction API

**Description:** This Flask API utilizes a pre-trained linear regression model to predict the selling price of a used car based on its weight.

**Dependencies:**

* Flask
* scikit-learn
* joblib

**Endpoints:**

* `/predict_rv` (**POST**): This endpoint accepts a JSON request containing the car's weight (`weight`) and returns the predicted selling price in JSON format.

**Request Format:**

```json
{
  "weight": <car weight in integer units (e.g., kilograms)>
}
```

**Response Format:**

```json
{
  "selling price": <predicted selling price as a list>
}
```

**Example Usage:**

```bash
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"weight": 1500}' http://localhost:5000/predict_rv
```

**Expected Response:**

```json
{
  "selling price": [<predicted price>]
}
```

**Notes:**

* The pre-trained linear regression model (`rev_model.joblib`) needs to be present in the same directory as this script.
* The API runs in debug mode (`debug=True`) when executed directly. For production deployment, consider setting it to `False`.

**Test Script Documentation (test.py.md)**

**Title:** Used Car Price Prediction API Test Script

**Description:** This script demonstrates how to send a POST request to the API endpoint and display the predicted selling price for a car with a weight of 5 kg.

**Dependencies:**

* requests

**Script:**

```python
import requests
import json

url = 'http://localhost:5000/predict_rv'
data = {"weight": 5}

response = requests.post(url, json=data)
print(response.json())
```

**Output:**

```json
{
  "selling price": [<predicted price>]
}
```

**Testing Instructions:**

1. Ensure the Flask API (`rev_main.py`) is running (e.g., `python rev_main.py`).
2. Run the test script (`python test.py`).

The script will display the predicted selling price for a car weighing 5 kg, as estimated by the API.

**Additional Notes:**

* Consider replacing placeholders like `<predicted price>` with actual values for clarity.
* You can expand the documentation to include information about the linear regression model's training data, performance metrics, and limitations.
* If the API requires authentication, add details on how to authenticate requests in the documentation.

I hope this comprehensive documentation is helpful!

Certainly, here's the documentation for the provided code (`abw_main.py`) and its test script (`test_abw.py`):

**API Documentation (abw_main.py.md)**

**Title:** ABW Prediction API

**Description:** This Flask API leverages a pre-trained linear regression model (`abw_model.joblib`) to predict a value denoted by `sr%` (possibly removal rate percentage) based on two input features:

* `abd_daya`: This likely represents some measure of applied force.
* `sum_sample_g`: This could indicate the total sample weight in grams.

**Dependencies:**

* Flask
* scikit-learn
* joblib

**Endpoints:**

* `/predict_abw` (**POST**): This endpoint accepts a JSON request containing the two features (`abd_daya` and `sum_sample_g`) and returns the predicted `sr%` value in JSON format.

**Request Format:**

```json
{
  "abd_daya": <value representing applied force>,
  "sum_sample_g": <total sample weight in grams>
}
```

**Response Format:**

```json
{
  "sr%": <predicted removal rate percentage as a list>
}
```

**Example Usage:**

```bash
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"abd_daya": 10, "sum_sample_g": 15}' http://localhost:5000/predict_abw
```

**Expected Response:**

```json
{
  "sr%": [<predicted SR%>]
}
```

**Notes:**

* The pre-trained linear regression model (`abw_model.joblib`) needs to be present in the same directory as this script.
* The API runs in debug mode (`debug=True`) when executed directly. For production deployment, consider setting it to `False`.

**Test Script Documentation (test_abw.py.md)**

**Title:** ABW Prediction API Test Script

**Description:** This script demonstrates making a POST request to the API endpoint and displaying the predicted `sr%` for specific values of `abd_daya` and `sum_sample_g`.

**Dependencies:**

* requests

**Script:**

```python
import requests
import json

url = 'http://localhost:5000/predict_abw'
data = {"abd_daya": 5, "sum_sample_g": 8}

response = requests.post(url, json=data)
print(response.json())
```

**Output:**

```json
{
  "sr%": [<predicted SR%>]
}
```

**Testing Instructions:**

1. Ensure the Flask API (`abw_main.py`) is running (e.g., `python abw_main.py`).
2. Run the test script (`python test_abw.py`).

The script will display the predicted `sr%` value based on the provided input values, as estimated by the API.

**Additional Notes:**

Absolutely, here's the updated documentation incorporating the new test script (`test_bio.py`):

**API Documentation (abw_main.py.md)** (Unchanged)

**Test Script Documentation (test_bio.py.md)**

**Title:** Biomass Prediction API Test Script (assuming the API endpoint is `/predict_bio` based on the test script)

**Description:** This script demonstrates making a POST request to the API endpoint and displaying the predicted biomass value for specific values of `total_seed` and `area`.

**Dependencies:**

* requests

**Script:**

```python
import requests
import json

url = 'http://localhost:5000/predict_bio'  # Assuming the endpoint is /predict_bio
data = {"total_seed": 5, "area": 8}

response = requests.post(url, json=data)
print(response.json())
```

**Output:**

```json
{
  "biomass": [<predicted biomass value>]  # Assuming the response key is "biomass"
}
```

**Testing Instructions:**

1. Ensure the Flask API (`abw_main.py`) is running (e.g., `python abw_main.py`).
2. Run the test script (`python test_bio.py`).

The script will display the predicted biomass value based on the provided input values, as estimated by the API.

**Important Notes:**

* The API documentation (abw_main.py.md) remains unchanged as it describes the functionality of the Flask API itself.
* This test script assumes the API endpoint for biomass prediction is `/predict_bio` based on the code snippet. Update the URL in the script if the actual endpoint is different.
* The response format is also assumed to contain a key named `"biomass"` for the predicted value. Adjust the script's output parsing if the response key has a different name.

I hope this clarifies the documentation for both the API and the test script!

* Consider replacing placeholders like `<predicted SR%>` with actual values for clarity.
* You can expand the documentation to include information about the linear regression model's training data, performance metrics, and limitations.
* If the API requires authentication, add details on how to authenticate requests in the documentation.

I hope this comprehensive documentation is helpful!
